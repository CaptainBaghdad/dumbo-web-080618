1. Add DOMConentLoaded event listener. This will execute all your code one the page loads.

2. Fetch some data and put things on the page

3. To put things on page:

// CREATE ELEMENT WAY
- create an outer element
- add properties to it
- add innerHTML to it?
- add event listeners to it
- put it on the DOM
- if you haven't append it, it isn't on the DOM

4. DOMContentLoaded should also add any event listeners for things ALREADY on the DOM (in your index.html)
<!-- 4. Listen for form submission
5. Grab input information
6. send somewhere -->


### Setting up a Form Event Listener
- grab reference to the form
- add a submit event listener to the form
- PREVENT DEFAULT
- get values
- send values somewhere
-


## Many event listeners
- add it at the time you create the object
- use event delegation
